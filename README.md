I do not endorse piracy. It's bad and illegal.
This includes the following repo:[^1]

- acer51-doctom/how-to-JNUSTool -- Don't download Wii U system files without owning one. That's considered piracy[^2].


[^1]: Note to developper (aka myself) that I need to update this regularly.
[^2]: Piracy is bad and illegal. I do not take responsibility for what you did.
